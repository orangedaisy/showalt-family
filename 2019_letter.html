        <p>Merry Christmas to all of our friends and family! I hope this
        message finds you well and enjoying all of the fun things that come
        with this special time of year.</p>

        <p>Looking back on 2019, I thought it’d be fun to recap some of the
        highlights of our year and share them with our tribe, if you will. 2019
        was our first full year as a family of 4 and we certainly made the most
        out of this year together!</p>

        <p>Our first exciting event was traveling to Louisiana for Mardi Gras.
        We did 2 parades with the boys and spent another day in the French
        Quarter.  Owen still talks about feeding marshmallows to the
        alligators, at which point most people look at me trying to decide if
        he’s making it up or if he really did feed marshmallows to alligators.
        We had such a fun time together with a lot of my side of the family.</p>

        <p>In April, we celebrated Owen’s 3rd birthday! Another reminder how
        quickly time flies. We had a small gathering here at the house for a
        Paw Patrol themed party. He has blossomed and grown so much this last
        year. He is learning to read now and loves to do preschool at home. He
        is so caring and sweet with his friends and most of the time with Arlo
        too.</p>

        <p>May brought our 6th wedding anniversary. So much has changed for the
        better during these past 6 years. We were able to celebrate while we
        visited Atlanta for a friends wedding. Bobby was a groomsman for
        Dustin, who was his best man.</p>

        <p>We also participated in our first March for Babies with the March of
        Dimes. This cause is something that has become near and dear to my
        heart with our two premie babies. We plan on attending again in
        2020!</p>

        <p>All summer, Bobby was able to work 10 hour days and flex every
        Wednesday off. We made 3 trips to Dollywood, searched for Waldo
        downtown, and visited our friends at the Zoo. We also enjoyed some
        relaxing days at home just enjoying being together as well.</p>

        <p>In July, Bobby worked in the office in Pennsylvania for a week. I
        flew up and joined him for a long weekend getaway. We ate our way
        through New York City on Saturday and enjoyed going to the race at
        Pocono Raceway on Sunday.</p>

        <p>Arlo’s first birthday was in September! We celebrated our baby with
        a brunch themed birthday party and tons of balloons. Arlo has is own
        personality now and it is so fun watching him discover the world around
        him. He loves to make you laugh and also enjoys snuggling with anyone
        who will hold him. </p>

        <p>October brought out all things pumpkin! We were able to do a pumpkin
        patch as a family with our life group from church. For the third year
        in a row, we went trick-or-treating at the Zoo. Owen had so much fun
        dressing up at Jeff Probst, with mom and dad dressed as Survivor
        contestants and Arlo as our “reward” of popcorn. </p>

        <p>Bobby and I were able to march with the alumni band at Tennessee’s
        homecoming in early November this year. We celebrated the 150th year of
        the Pride with over 1,100 members on the field with the current and
        alumni band. It was a lot of people and a lot of fun! We actually got
        the first snow of the season at the beginning of November. Owen now
        keeps telling me he can’t wait for our Christmas snow to arrive.
        Thanksgiving was fairly low key for us this year.  We were able to host
        my cousin Kristen for a couple of days and got to have a short visit
        with all of Bobby’s immediate family Friday.</p>

        <p>Our entire family is looking forward to all the fun December holds.
        We’ve got some really fun things planned for when Bobby gets some time
        off the second half of the month.</p>

        <p>Whew, what a year! We lived and loved a lot this year. We’re ready
        for some new adventures in 2020.</p>

        <p>We wish you and yours a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New
        Year!</p>

        <p>Love, <span class="family-names">Bobby, Stephanie, Owen, and
          Arlo</span></p>
