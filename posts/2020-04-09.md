Today was a fairly normal day in this new quarantine existence. Today was a pajama day for the boys. They played with trains and built some cool tracks (with parental help). Bobby spent a lot of the evening putting the finishing touches on the big surprise for Owen's birthday. Stephanie's creation of the day is was peanut butter chocolate chip banana pancakes for the boys for dinner.
