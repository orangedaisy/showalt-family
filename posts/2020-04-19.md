Church at home again this morning. Stephanie made bagel sandwiches that were delicious. After church, the whole family played with trains and built tracks all over the living room. After dinner, Bobby and Owen worked on learning how to play chess together. They had a lot of fun. All the days are really running together at this point. And nothing is nearly as exciting as it was 40 days ago.
