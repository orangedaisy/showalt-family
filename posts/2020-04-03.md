Stephanie and the boys had a relaxing morning. Arlo is figuring out how to put the train tracks together and he makes the best faces when he gets 2 pieces connected! After naps, Stephanie opted to take the boys outside and Owen begged to go for a walk. About halfway through, Owen decided that he was hot and wanted to just go back to play in the driveway. It was so warm, Stephanie filled up the water table and let them play with the water in the regular clothes. Bobby brought Cooper out and joined the rest of the family for a little while before we headed inside for dinner.

Statewide, cases surpassed 3,000 in Tennessee. Knox county is knocking on the door of 100 cases. The CDC released a recommendation now that all people should wear a mask when out in public. Stephanie plans on making us some for in the event we must visit a store for food or necessary supplies. 

Stephanie attempted a visit to Costco during naps; however, there was a line of 50-75 people waiting to get into the store. Luckily, we don't need anything from there desperately. So she set up a Kroger order, but the earliest pickup available was Tuesday.
