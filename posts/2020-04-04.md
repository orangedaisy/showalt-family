Normal Saturdays are errand days where we wonder around the mall or visit different stores. We've definitely been missing that rhythm in our house, so after a quick breakfast we loaded up just for a car ride. We drove along the river, weaving our way to campus. Man, is it weird to see campus completely empty! We maybe saw 5 people walking around, which is fewer than we saw even that summer we stayed in Knoxville for summer school and working for the band. After an eerie drive down an empty Gay Street downtown, we were all hungry. We decided to support a local sandwich shop with the best lemon cookies. The boys refused naps, so to keep the mood up, we headed out for some water table time this evening! When it was time for dinner, we let the boys eat outside in the back of the Tribeca, since the driveway gets no shade and it was very hot. They loved the picnic in the back of the car! Definitely something we'll have to do again, even though the trunk is usually full of things needed for regular outings. 

Tonight, Bobby and Stephanie hosted a game night with a different group of friends. Though this one was cut short because of fussy babies, we really enjoyed connecting with a group that we don't get to see near as often as we'd like.

Cases are rising, though Knox county only reported 1 new case.
