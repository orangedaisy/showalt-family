It's officially been 2 weeks since our last outing with the boys where they were allowed to run around and touch things. It is so crazy to think that everyone was joking and laughing about toilet paper hoarding and we're now 2 weeks in. 

Alro ate an entire container of blackberries for breakfast! Stephanie took the boys to run some errands (none required getting out of the car) before getting out the water table after nap. They enjoyed splashing and playing so much.
