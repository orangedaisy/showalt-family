Today was our first full day at home. We worked a few puzzles with the boys,
then went outside to blow off some energy with chalk and basketball.

In the evening, we played Super Mario Party with Owen. Some of the little mini
games were too tough for him, but he did well in picking up the concept and
making decisions on his own. He would've won, too, if the computer didn't decide
to award Stephanie some pity stars at the very end &#128513;. We also used SMP's
Sound Stage mode to get the blood pumping and burn off a little bit more energy
before bed.
