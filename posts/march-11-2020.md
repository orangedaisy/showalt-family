This is the first entry in our [COVID-19
&nearr;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
quarantine journal. We will use this journal to track our efforts to protect our
family from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and how we are coping with life in
quarantine.

Today we decided we would begin social distancing and self-quarantine on
Thursday out of an abundance of caution. Stephanie and the boys attended a bible
study in the morning, then had lunch with friends from church before coming home
to prepare. Afraid that personal hygiene supplies would soon be limited, we
placed a drive-up order from Target for diapers, wipes, toilet paper, soap,
shampoo, and toothpaste.

This evening, the NBA [cancelled their
season](https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1238297808291033088) after a player for
the Utah Jazz tested positive.
