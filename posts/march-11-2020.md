Today we decided we would begin social distancing and self-quarantine on
Thursday out of an abundance of caution. Stephanie and the boys attended a bible
study in the morning, then had lunch with friends from church before coming home
to prepare. Afraid that personal hygiene supplies would soon be limited, we
placed a drive-up order from Target for diapers, wipes, toilet paper, soap,
shampoo, and toothpaste.

This evening, the NBA [cancelled their

the Utah Jazz tested positive.
