Today was fairly normal for the entire family, except Stephanie's Tuesday bible study has been postponed indefinitely.

We awoke to the first confirmed case in Sevier county and the news that Knox county schools will be out through the end of the month, at least. Stephanie spent lot of today checking in on friends from church, mom's club, and friends we keep in contact with from college. So far, everyone seems to be social distancing and keeping kids safe. And they claim to have enough toilet paper! 

Owen completed a couple of preschool lessons, a highlight of his day. After nap, Stephanie took the boys outside to enjoy snacks and burn off some energy. Before dinner, the entire family took a walk for the third night in a row. The regular routine amongst the unease has been a bright point. After dinner, Owen requested that we play a game, so we chose Super Mario Party on our Nintendo Switch. And the winner was...Owen! He was really excited after his crushing loss over the weekend!
