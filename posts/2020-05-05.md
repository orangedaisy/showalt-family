Happy Cinco de Mayo! We did nothing to celebrate here. It was a much needed slow morning inside. After 2 days spent mostly outside, we enjoyed taking some time to relax and take it slow. Stephanie and Owen did more school work. After naps, we relaxed and watched some cooking shows. Nothing of note, but a fairly good day.
