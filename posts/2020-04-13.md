The day after an eventful weekend is always difficult. The reality that we are still home really set in with nothing really to look forward to in the coming weeks. The weather forecast isn't great for being outside. The governor extended the safer-at-home order through the end of the month. This wasn't surprising, but it was still a stark reality against the celebration of Easter and Owen's birthday. We did school with Owen, Arlo enjoyed coloring in his new coloring book, and then napped. Owen had fun playing with some new Lego that arrived from Aunt Kelsey as a late birthday present after nap.
