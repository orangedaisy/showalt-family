It's Wednesday, so that means lawn care day for our complex. So the boys were entertained for the morning watching the lawn mowers, weed eaters, and blowers come by the window. Owen helped Stephanie make a buttermilk cake! We had it after lunch and it was delicious. Stephanie spent the afternoon reorganizing Owen's school stuff and the nook with her desk. Owen has completed about 50 pages worth of kindergarten level worksheets since this whole ordeal started and he finished his k primer book. He loves to learn!

Knox county is knocking on the door of 150 cases. The deaths continue to mount state and nationwide. It is so sad to think of all of the families impacted by this pandemic.
