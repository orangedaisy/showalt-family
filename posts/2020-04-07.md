Knox county is up to 143 cases as of today. Statewide, we surpassed 4,000 with 74 deaths. That is nearly double the deaths in 48 hours. 

Stephanie had arranged for a Kroger Clicklist pickup for this afternoon, so she spent most of the morning cleaning out the fridge and organizing to make room for the new stuff. Owen wanted to do some schoolwork in the morning. They ended up calling to say that the order was late, but it only ended up being about 30 minutes late. We were able to get everything except for yogurt and peanut butter. They also only gave us 3 of the 5 milks we ordered. (That's just a 1 week supply. Not trying to hoard, but we go through a lot of milk.) After we finally go all the groceries unload, Stephanie was able to take the boys outside for some water table time before dinner. After dinner, Bobby and Owen built a super awesome train track and played some Pokemon on the Gameboy Color.
