It was a rainy day and we all felt the mood change after a beautiful sunny day.  The boys played with the end of the wrapping paper after I wrapped presents for a friend. Stephanie was able to take the boys out for a walk after naps, but they had to hurry home as sprinkles were starting.

75+ new cases in Tennessee today, and increasing cases in the east region. Knox county has closed all bars and limited restaurants eat in to 50% capacity. No changes to take out yet, but we're noticing more and more service industries closing to help flatten the curve.
