The last week was long and stressful. We had a couple of really hard days, probably due to the weather keeping us trapped inside. 

Yesterday started Phase 1 of the state opening back up. Restaurants are able to open seating up to 50% and retail stores are allowed to open their doors, with the understanding that guests need to maintain a 6 foot distance from one another and masks are highly encouraged whenever you enter a store. In Knox county specifically, salons and personal services are also allowed to open and churches can resume services under strict guidelines. Personally, we are choosing to stay home because we can and to keep our boys safe. 

Today we went for quite a long drive just trying to look at something different from our 4 walls and what we can see beyond the driveway. It is good for the soul, for the adults at least. Owen would rather just stay home. We picked up some Mexican food from one of our favorite local restaurants for lunch. After lunch, it was inside play and lots of TV.
