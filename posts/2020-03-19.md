We had an exciting day today! It started out with our first injury of the quarantine. Arlo fell and busted his lip pretty good. But he bounced back quickly when he saw banana on his plate for breakfast! 

We brought out the huge container of wooden tracks for some morning fun while we waited for the rain to stop. Both of the boys had a blast building tracks. Stephanie took the boys out for a picnic for lunch and some outdoor play leading up to quiet time. 

After naps, we were able to fill up the water table in the driveway because the weather was beautiful! The boys spent over an hour splashing, pouring water, and washing army men. We then loaded up in the car for the first time in almost a week and headed to pick up a Target order. We grabbed fast food for dinner to treat the boys. We watched Survivor and then built more tracks before bed.
