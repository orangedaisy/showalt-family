Disney released Frozen II to Disney+ early, so we made plans to watch it
together after the church livestream. Bobby ran out to Publix early in the
morning to check on their stock of things and grab some special movie snacks for
the boys. All paper goods were still sold out, but most other foodstuffs were in
decent supply. Hopefully more stock is on the way to keep the masses from
panicking more.

We took a walk around our apartment complex last night to burn off some energy.
Owen and Stephanie did some more preschool before everyone settled in at the end
of a very long weekend.
