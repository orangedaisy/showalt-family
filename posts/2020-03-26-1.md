Tennessee surpassed the 1,000 cases mark today. We were expecting it, but it still caught us off guard a little. The US also has surpassed most every other country in death toll, which is not a stat we were not expecting. 

We had an absolutely beautiful day in Knoxville today. Stephanie and the boys went out this morning for little bit of chalk and sunshine. The water table made an appearance after a (very short) nap time time. The boys splashed and played in the driveway for almost 2 hours. After dinner, Stephanie took the boys for a walk. Overtired Arlo went straight to bed, but Owen stayed up and played Pokemon on the Gameboy with Bobby for the first time. Better moods all around today!
