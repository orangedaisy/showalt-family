Tennessee surpassed the 1,000 cases mark today. We were expecting it, but it still caught us off guard a little. The US also has surpassed most every other country in death toll, which is not a stat we were not expecting. 

We had an absolutely beautiful day in Knoxville today. Stephanie and the boys went out this morning for little bit of chalk and sunshine. We decided to load up the entire family and drive over 20 minutes away to a local coffee shop owned by Daytona 500 Champ Trevor Bayne and his wife. Trevor was actually at the shop roasting coffee and came to talk to us about what beans they had available. Owen was shy, but thought it was really cool that he was a real Nascar driver.

The water table made an appearance after a (very short) nap time time. The boys splashed and played in the driveway for almost 2 hours. After dinner, Stephanie took the boys for a walk. Overtired Arlo went straight to bed, but Owen stayed up and played Pokemon on the Gameboy with Bobby for the first time. Better moods all around today!
