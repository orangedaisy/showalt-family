Cases in Tennessee jumped 60% overnight to 372 total cases with only 1 death. We had decided last night to support our favorite local breakfast place by getting it to go, but they made the decision late last night to close at least over the weekend and reevaluate what next steps they'll be taking. Instead, we supported a local donut shop who has started doing drive up. 

We watched Mulan late this morning. Owen said he didn't like it, but he didn't stop watching. After naps, we did our nightly family walk, which was chilly but definitely needed. We watched some Barefoot Contessa to end our day before baths and bed. A relaxing Saturday at home, just missing our usual routine of running errands and wandering at various stores.
