The report today was not good for Knox county. Cases topped 50 and the first death was reported today. Governor Bill Lee issued a "Safer-at-Home" order for the entire state, closing all non-essential businesses in the entire state. A news story was released late last night regarding independent projections for TN. Peak hospitalizations are estimated to be around April 12, with the state being short over 150 beds. Death toll would peak around 51 on April 21, with 1,551 deaths total in the state by August. 

As for our family today, we had a great day! Stephanie let the boys ride along to grab some breakfast and our grocery pick up order. When they got home, Owen did lots of preschool activities and 4 yoga videos from YouTube. Leftovers for lunch, followed by naps. After naps, Stephanie took the boys on a walk and let them play outside for a few minutes before coming in for dinner. After dinner, Bobby, Stephanie, and Owen played Sorry!, Mancala, and Chutes and Ladders. Another day of family fun!
