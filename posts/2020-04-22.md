Today was a fairly calm day. We played inside a lot and Owen did a school lesson. Stephanie took the boys for a walk after nap. We had a really low key day.

We're still awaiting more details about opening back up here in Knoxville. I think everyone is getting a little anxious about helping small businesses.
