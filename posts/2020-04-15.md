Knox County Schools officially announced, at the request of the governor, that school would be out through the end of the year. Having missed 6 weeks of Sophomore year of high schools, Stephanie definitely feels for and can relate to, the students who are going through this period with no school. 

This morning, we received a grocery delivery from Publix. We were critically low on milk, so this became a necessity in our house. The first pickup available (as of Sunday) at Kroger was for Friday. It was nice to get groceries delivered straight to the door. Family walk returned after nap because it was actually a nice evening. Stephanie decided to bake some bread and mix up some blueberry scones for breakfast this evening.
