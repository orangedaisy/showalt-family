Today was uneventful. for the most part. Cases are mounting in Tennessee, though the bulk of the cases are located in middle TN. Owen and Stephanie did lots of preschool and Arlo even sat at the table with us and colored! No walk this evening, as sprinkles moved in right about the time we were going to leave. We watched some children's authors read their own books instead. Jimmy Fallon's This is Baby had Arlo enthralled! We ended our night with another round of Mario Party. Bobby was the winner tonight!

Bobby did make a run to Publix to back fill some items we had used since our last trip on Friday. He found more empty shelves than last week, so we're appreciating that we had stocked up on most things earlier.
