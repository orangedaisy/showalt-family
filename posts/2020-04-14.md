Tuesday morning started off with Stephanie's bible study meeting virtually. It was the last week of our study of the book of Romans. We will pick up the book of Philippians next week. After naps, the boys were cranky, so Stephanie took them on a walk to check the mail. We've started letting Arlo walk by himself and he always looks like such a big boy. Arlo worked a wooden puzzle while Owen and Bobby worked on the Pokemon puzzle he got for his birthday. After, Owen and Arlo got rides on our shoulders. They loved it, but its brutal on mommy and daddy.
