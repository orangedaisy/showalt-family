Bobby went back to work today after taking Friday off. Stephanie and the boys
managed their first quarantine day with Bobby at work pretty well.

It's starting to sink in how real this is becoming. None of us are showing any
symptoms of anything yet, so we're hopeful we took enough measures before we may
have been exposed. To distract from the growing cloud of uncertainty, Stephanie
and Owen took to the kitchen to whip up some savory breakfast muffins (made of
pancake batter, cheese, and sausage baked in muffin tins), blueberry scones, and
cinnamon rolls. Our fridge and freezer are packed with delicious treats for now
&#128516;. Owen and Arlo both enjoyed some of the new episodes of Thomas the
Tank Engine that were recently added to Netflix.
