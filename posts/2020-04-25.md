As has become the tradition for our Saturdays, we took a family drive. It was the first time any of us have left the house since our last Saturday drive. We just drove all over Knox county seeing what all we could get into.  We decided to grab some lunch from one of our favorite local places to support a local business. It was a delicious burger! Arlo fell asleep on our drive, so Stephanie carried him up to nap. Owen stayed up to eat his lunch, but was very tired as soon as Arlo woke up. So we did naps in shifts today, which means mom and dad didn't really get a break. The boys played trains and watched some TV before dinner.
