This morning, Stephanie made cauliflower bagels from scratch with bacon and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast, she baked a loaf of sandwich bread. It was delicious! We used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches to go with homemade tomato soup. The boys played with train tracks and watched some TV while Stephanie spent some time in the kitchen. Owen did some preschool both before and after nap, with Arlo joining in for the after nap portion! It was a full, yet fun day.

Cases are mounting, but definitely slower than we all expected. Hopefully it is truly a flattening of the curve and not a lag in reporting or testing. Only time will tell.
