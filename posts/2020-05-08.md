Movie night! We decided to make today special for the boys. We didn't have a clue what movie we would watch, but decided to do a movie night. After a low key morning, Stephanie made (with some assistance from Bobby) a batch of homemade soft pretzels. They were delicious! Owen won't eat popcorn, so that's his movie snack of choice. The boys also had hot dogs for dinner and cookies for dessert. We decided to watch Toy Story. They loved it! Arlo actually watched the majority of it.
