Our church offered online services again this morning. There is a meme circulating that jokes about how church at home needs better childcare. And we agree! But it is nice to see familiar faces and to stay connected in worship. We spent the rest of the morning watching some shows before we ordered pizza for lunch. While the boys napped, Stephanie and Bobby were able to watch some Nascar folks drive via iRacing, which is a video game that is incredibly realistic. After naps, we spent about an hour and a half outside. Baths and bedtime followed.

Tennessee surpassed 1,500 cases as a state and Knox county has 38 cases. We have doubled since Thursday. Knox county is less than a week into "safer at home", so we expect the numbers to continue to climb for another week or so.
