We made it to Friday! (Surely we can still look forward to the weekend, right?) Lots of trains this morning that were left set up from Bobby's masterpiece last night. After a rough nap time, Stephanie took the boys on a walk and then pulled out some play doh sand outside. They enjoyed making a huge mess in the driveway and throwing it in each other's hair. After watching Survivor for this week, we turned on some old videos of Supermarket Sweep. Owen loves that show, so he enjoyed getting to see them run through the aisles.
