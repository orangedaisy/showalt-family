Another wonderful day here in Knoxville. It was actually warm enough to get the water table out in the morning. Stephanie took the boys out for over 2 hours before lunch. After lunch, Stephanie was able to do school with Owen. His reading is improving leaps and bounds. He is thriving with this new curriculum. After naps, the whole family went back outside with the water table and some new tennis balls. We spent another 2+ hours outside. It was a great day!
