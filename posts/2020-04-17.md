Finally Friday - do we still celebrate Friday in this nonsense land? We had a grocery pickup order ready at 8am, so Stephanie loaded up the boys to get 10 days worth of food. It was definitely the biggest grocery order for our family to date - 5 gallons of milk, 16 containers of berries, and 36 eggs. The only thing they didn't have was yeast and we're critically low. After we got the groceries home and unloaded, it was a relaxing morning. Owen and Arlo played. Owen did a yoga video. Lunch was sandwiches on the end of the bread Stephanie made the day before with the homemade french onion dip was delicious! After naps, we were able to get the water table out and the boys really enjoyed it. Bobby joined the family after he logged off and we played with balls until dinner time.
