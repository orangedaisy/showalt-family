Saturday was a good day. After breakfast, we loaded up and headed out for a drive. We wound our way up to north Knoxville and showed Owen our old stomping grounds. Owen requested Chick-fil-A for dinner, so we made it happen. We brought it home and then got the boys down for a nap. Stephanie tackled cleaning the playroom then we all settled in for a rest. The boys fought nap, so they slept until dinner time. After dinner, Bobby played trains with the boys. Then before we knew it, bedtime was upon us. 

Its been a while since we've recorded numbers, so we thought we'd include them today. Tennessee is at 6,752 confirmed cases with over 90,000 tests performed. So far, 145 people have lost their lives. Knox county is up to 194 confirmed cases, which is the lowest of the 3 big cities in TN by a substantial amount.
