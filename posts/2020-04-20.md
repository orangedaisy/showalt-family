This morning was interesting. Arlo figured out how to turn on the TV and was so proud of himself. After naps, we got to play outside for a couple of hours. It was warm enough for water table. We decided to get out Owen's new sprinkler. Arlo loved it! Owen was a little unsure of running through it, but loved filling cups with the water.

Today was exciting for another reason as well! Owen's new Kindergarten curriculum arrived! We had plans to start him this fall, but since we're home now and needing more challenging activities, we decided to jump in now. We will likely take some time off later during the summer to do all the fun things once they open back up and again at the holidays. He is really enjoying everything he is learning and is excited to do schoolwork each day. 

The governor announced today that the safer at home order will expire April 30 for 89 counties in Tennessee. That leaves 6 counties with their own health departments to make the decision for themselves about opening back up. Knox county is 1 of the 6 that weren't reopened by the order. We are still waiting for further details from our county mayor about more details regarding open up some non-essential businesses.
