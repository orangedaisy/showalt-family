This morning was interesting. Arlo figured out how to turn on the TV and was so proud of himself. After naps, we got to play outside for a couple of hours. It was warm enough for water table. We decided to get out Owen's new sprinkler. Arlo loved it! Owen was a little unsure of running through it, but loved filling cups with the water.
