Happy Easter! We celebrated with baskets overflowing with outdoor toys, swim shoes, coloring books, some new board games, books for reading, and a chocolate bunny. It was weird to watch church online for Easter Sunday. Stephanie made a delicious lunch of Marry Me Chicken, mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, and scratch-made rolls. When Stephanie ordered Owen's cake, she also got a cookie decorating kit for Easter, so we did that after nap and enjoyed the cookies for dessert. While the boys napped, Bobby helped hide Easter eggs in our living room for the boys the hunt. Arlo loved it! Owen was more worried Arlo than looking for the eggs. We also played a bunch of new games the boys got for birthday/Easter. We had a great day!
