Today was hard. The boys are becoming more stir crazy and it showed today. We watched church this morning and our only complaint about online church is the childcare is lacking. The boys ate lunch and went down for naps, while mom and dad had a day date with frozen pizza while watching NASCAR iRacing. Naps were far too short. Bedtime provided much needed relief. 

Knox county reached 115 cases today. The news is starting to say that this week will be the worst for cases and deaths in the majority of the US.
