Another day of staying home. Stephanie was able to video chat with some mom's club friends in the morning. It was nice to reconnect with them and check in on their families. Then Stephanie took the boys outside for about an hour for chalk and toys. Owen woke up way before Arlo (because of super short naps Thursday), so he got to play outside with the water table by himself for over an hour. When Arlo woke up, the boys both played piano for a little bit before dinner. After dinner, we were able to relax and watch some tv. 

The US now has more cases than any other country. More cases locally as well. There are now some scary reports coming out of New York about hospitals being overcrowded. Praying that we don't get to that point in Knoxville.
