Knoxville had another day full of rain today. Stephanie took the boys out for a picnic breakfast before it really picked up. When they came back inside, Stephanie set up a race track obstacle course for them to race Hot Wheels on. That was definitely a hit, but Cooper and Arlo were always wild cards being in the way or moving the obstacles!

After nap, Owen did some preschool work with Stephanie and Arlo was not happy that she didn't have any activities to do with him. As a family, we watched Alton Brown and his wife live stream making dinner at their house since they are quarantined like the rest of us. This was the second Tuesday in a row that they have done this and they plan to continue as long as we are all social distancing! It has been very neat to watch the way in which celebrities and others have used social media for positive and uplifting things during this difficult time.

Knox county announced as only an increase of 3 cases overnight, with only an 8% jump in cases in the entire state. There are reports circulating of resulting taking as long as 5 days to come back, so it's quite possible there are more infected, but not confirmed through testing.
