We started the day bright and early with a trip to Publix and Target to grab the
final groceries we'll need to weather the next few weeks. To minimize the boys'
contact with public surfaces, we kept them in our double stroller for around the
stores. They were sad they couldn't ride in the fun race car and double carts we
normally use, but they handled it well otherwise.

NASCAR and the fledgling XFL finally cancelled their seasons. Our church also
moved their services to online-only for at least the next couple of weeks.

The rest of the day was pretty low-key. We hung out with the boys and let them
control the tv for a while. Bobby started teaching some basic musical rhythm
concepts to Owen, and he picked it up extremely quickly! Working with Owen on
his preschool and new skills will be an important distraction in the coming
weeks.
