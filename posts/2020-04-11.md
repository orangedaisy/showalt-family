Owen turns 4!! We celebrated a day early because his birthday fell on Easter and during the quarantine times, no one knows what day it is anyway. So we celebrated for 2 days!

Bobby had created an app on which Owen could catch Pokemon using QR codes and his cell phone. Owen was so very excited when we read him a letter! He was very excited to take Bobby around looking for the Pokemon. We had donuts for breakfast (thanks Mimi and Pepper). Bobby had the idea to make pokeball pancakes, so we colored some pancake batter and and made some pokeballs. After naps, we watched some Pokemon tv shows, played with new toys, and did cake and sang Happy Birthday.

We all loaded up to get some Chick-fil-A for dinner after eating donuts, pancakes, and cake all day. It was Owen's request for chicken nuggets. 

At bedtime, Stephanie was talking to Owen about his day. His favorite part was hunting Pokemon. And when she asked him if it was a good day, he responded "I don't think anyone will ever believe how awesome today was!" And it really was a great day. Just missing our family getting together to celebrate him.
