Welp, Tennessee hit 505 cases. We expect the numbers to continue to climb, but it is surreal to watch the counts rise daily. We were able to place an order for Kroger Pick Up this morning (we had to start it 3 days ago, but were given the option to edit as needed) simply to replace things we were using and of course we needed more milk. There were some substitutions, but we were able to meet all of our needs!

The entire family was able to watch church online, including a special video the boys would normally watch during their time in childcare. After church, we played Chutes and Ladders. This was Owen's first time playing and he actually won one round! Stephanie won the other 2. 

After lunch and while Arlo was down for nap, Owen was able to do a preschool lesson and did great! After nap, Owen helped Stephanie make a chocolate cake from scratch. He really enjoyed making the ganache and helping mix the batter. After dinner, we all settled in for a round of Sorry!, another game that was new for Owen. Bobby was the winner this time!
