At breakfast, Owen was really excited to read Arlo a book. It was so cute to see him so excited. Arlo sat himself down and started petting Cooper while Owen did a school lesson. They really are best friends. Stephanie brought out one of Owen's old books and Arlo really enjoyed reading through it. He begged all day to read different parts again. He's getting close to talking and enjoyed hearing the words repeatedly. It was a rainy day, so Bobby promised Owen that they would make a box into a tunnel for his Thomas engines. They had a lot of fun chugging the engines.
