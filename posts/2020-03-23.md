Knox county more than doubled the number of reported cases overnight. We are also now under a "safer at home" order, meaning non-essential businesses open to the public are to close for good by midnight. Grocery stores, pharmacies, and doctors offices will remain open, and restaurants will still be able to serve to go and deliveries. 

This morning was a regular morning for Stephanie and the boys, including some preschool and independent play. We decided to support a local restaurant and pick up some burgers for lunch! Walking into a usually bustling diner with no one in the dining room was a somewhat shocking experience for Stephanie. Stephanie did some work changing out the boys clothes for warmer weather and for the next size up during nap time. Bobby showed Owen an old version of the Pokemon game before it was time for bed!
