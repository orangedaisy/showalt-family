Today was a good day! Bobby took the day off from work. We took a drive up to Mahalo Coffee for some more beans and for a yummy iced coffee. It was nice to soak up the sun and get out of the house for an hour or so. We spent some time building train tracks, watching some tv, and Bobby put the finishing touches on the surprise for Owen. 

After the boys went to bed, Stephanie went into party mode with Bobby's help. Pokemon came to visit us, 120 balloons were blown up for a balloon arch, and the table decorated with too many presents. It was so perfect for celebrating our 4 year old!
