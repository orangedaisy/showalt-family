Today was better. We caught a breath of fresh air. Owen was up a little early, but we were able to get some school in at breakfast. That usually seems to set our day up for success. Breakfast and lunch were delicious, which also improves Stephanie's mood. Stephanie took the boys outside after naps, and Bobby was able to join the family after work. It was so nice to get the water table back out and spend some time in the warm sun. We lost track of time, so we rushed in for a late dinner. We had a little time to play after dinner, then bedtime.

No real change in numbers locally overnight. Still bracing for what is expected to be a sad and long 2 weeks.
