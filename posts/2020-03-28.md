Saturday is usually full of running errands and being out and about. This morning, the boys enjoyed a lazy morning of cartoons. Stephanie really didn't feel like cooking, so we had leftover muffins and a frozen dinner for lunch. After naps, the entire family spent over 2 hours outside playing with the water table, playing basketball, or throwing the frisbee. We even ate our picnic dinner outside. 

Stephanie and Bobby hosted a Skype call to play games with some friends while social distancing. It was a lot of fun and provided some much needed adult interaction!

More cases are coming locally and nationally; however, at the state level, we seem to be at a daily growth rate of around 20%, which is much better than the 33-50% we were told to expect. We will continue to practice social distancing, as it seems to be flattening the curve.
