Finally, a beautiful weather day! We had scones for breakfast (they were delicious and the boys loved them!) We had sandwiches on our homemade bread for lunch. After naps, Stephanie and the boys spent the afternoon outside with chalk. This evening, Stephanie decided to caramelize onions to make homemade french onion dip in the morning. Bobby did an awesome job cutting the onions, while Stephanie gave the boys a bath. It was a team effort to cook them and it was worth the time.
