Today we cancelled plans with friends and family for Friday and Saturday. It was
difficult to tell those we love that we could not see them, but the risk of
spreading something is just too high.

Panic buying has begun as people are buying stores out of toilet paper. The
Target order we placed less than 24 hours ago wouldn't be possible now. Food
still seems to be in good supply, so we finalized a shopping list for groceries
to pick up first thing tomorrow.

After the NBA shut down yesterday, pretty much every remaining major
sports-related anything followed suit today. Knox County also reported their
first confirmed case of coronavirus. Knox County Schools announced they would
close on Friday for a to-be-determined duration.

Bobby's employer announced they would begin enforcing a work from home policy on
Friday. Stephanie and the boys had a fairly normal day of preschool and playing
outside. Our first day of social distancing is in the books.
