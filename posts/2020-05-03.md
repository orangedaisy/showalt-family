Today was a wonderful day. We did church at home and the boys got to watch their lesson. Bobby and Owen made cornmeal pancakes with strawberry compote for breakfast. That was a hit and a recipe we'll definitely make it again! After naps, we spent all evening outside with the water table. It was so hot, we even set up the tent to block out the sun. We took Cooper out with us and gave him a (much needed) bath and brushing. He's overdue for a haircut and so shaggy. The boys wore out the water table since we hadn't really gotten to play outside much last week. We came in for a late dinner before heading to bed. It was a much needed breath of fresh air for the entire family.
