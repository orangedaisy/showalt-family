It was colder today, so Stephanie couldn't get the boys outside until this afternoon. This morning was quiet here. Owen did more yoga videos. Stephanie pulled out the train tracks and then the boys enjoyed watching some episodes of Thomas and Friends. After naps, the boys played with chalk and Stephanie took them on a walk. While the boys had dinner, Bobby built a big fort for them. 

These last couple days, Stephanie has noticed Owen asking for more activities and asking where we're going each day. He's starting to notice the difference and going a little stir crazy. Stephanie had planned to start Kindergarten with Owen this summer, but we're planning on going ahead and ordering it soon to give him some additional mental stimulation.

Knox county is up to 78 cases and Tennessee has had a total of 24 deaths. We're just watching daily to see the numbers rise and waiting to see how high they will peak.
