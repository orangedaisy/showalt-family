ingredients:
  - 8 Tbsp unsalted butter, frozen + 2 Tbsp melted
  - 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1/2 cup sugar
  - 1/4 tsp baking soda
  - 1/2 cup sour cream, cold
  - 1/2 cup milk
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1 1/2 cups bluberries
  - coarse sugar for topping
method: >-
  1. Preheat oven to 425F with the rack in the middle. 

  2. Whisk all wet ingredients (1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla extract) together until smooth. Refrigerate.

  3. In a large bowl whisk together all dry ingredients (2 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda).

  4. Grate 8 tbsp frozen butter on a large holed box grater right into the flour mixture and toss together to coat the butter in flour. Add the cold wet ingredients and stir just until barely holds together.

  5. Dump the dough out onto your working surface and continue pressing the dough together until it holds shape, then fold several times to form a dough. Do not overwork it or the scones will be tough. Roll the dough into a rectangle (16" x 12") flouring the surface and the pin as needed. 

  6. Spread the berries all across the surface and press them in with the palms of your hands. Now fold or roll tightly into a log. Cut the log into 8 triangles and transfer to a baking sheet, spacing them evenly.

  7. Refrigerate or freeze the scones for 15-30 minutes so they retain their shape better when baking. Scones can be left in the fridge overnight for baking in the morning or frozen for storage up to 1 month.

  8. Melt 2 Tbsp of the butter and brush the tops of the scones, then generously sprinkle with coarse sugar. 

  9. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the tops are golden brown.
