method: >-
  1. Combine tangzhong ingredients in a small sauce pan. Heat over medium
  whisking constantly until a thick paste is formed. Transfer to a bowl and
  allow to cool while you prepare the other ingredients.

  2. Heat 1/2 cup of milk to 95-100 degrees F. Stir in yeast and allow to sit for 10 minutes. (Yeast should start to foam and bubble if it is alive.)

  3. Combine bread flour, sea salt, and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer. Add in your yeast mixture, tangzhong, and 1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk. Start your mixer of low (speed 2-4) with the dough hook and allow to mix until all ingredients are combined and no dry flour remains in the bottom of the bowl.

  4. Add butter 1 Tbsp at a time of softened butter. Mix until butter is fully incorporated. Allow the dough to continue kneading for another 5-7 minutes.

  5. Place dough on an unfloured (or very lightly flour if dough is too sticky) surface and form a tight ball.

  6. Place in a greased bowl and allow to rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

  7. Punch down dough and place it onto a floured work surface. Cut dough into 6 equal pieces (about 105g each).

  8. Shape each piece into a ball and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Cover with another rimmed baking sheet the same size and allow to rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

  9. Brush with egg wash at 375 degrees for 16-18 minutes. Once removed from the oven, brush with melted butter.
