ingredients:
  - 2 large chicken breasts
  - 1 cup salsa
  - 1/2 cup chicken broth
  - 1 packet of taco seasoning
method: >-
  1. Add chicken, salsa, broth, and taco seasoning to the bowl of your instant
  pot.

  2. Set to high pressure and cook for 24 minutes if thawed and 30 if frozen. 

  3. Allow to natural release for 10 minutes before quick releasing the remaining pressure.

  4. Pull chicken out and shred (I prefer to use a hand mixer). Add to the shredded chicken as much of the salsa mixture as you'd prefer and stir to combine. 

  5. Serve in tacos, as nachos, or on a bed of lettuce.
